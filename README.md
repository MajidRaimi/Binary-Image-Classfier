## Course Overview

The course is designed to help students understand the basic and advanced concepts of Image Processing using Python and TensorFlow. We'll dive into the methodologies and practices of Deep Learning, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their applications in Image Processing.

## What You Will Learn

- Basics of Image Processing
- Introduction to TensorFlow
- Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Building and Training a CNN with TensorFlow
- Using TensorFlow's pre-built DNNs
- Image Classification: Identifying emotions in images

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- TensorFlow 2.0 or later
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MajidRaimi/Binary-Image-Classfier
```

2. Install the necessary packages

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

3. Navigate to the code directory and run the Python files

```bash
cd code
python3 happy_sad_classification.py
```

## Course Structure

The course is divided into various modules, each focused on different aspects of Image Processing and TensorFlow:

- **Introduction to Image Processing**: This module introduces the basics of image processing, such as grayscale and color images, image file formats, and image operations.
- **TensorFlow and Deep Learning**: This module introduces TensorFlow and provides a detailed explanation of Deep Learning concepts, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- **Building a CNN with TensorFlow**: In this module, we'll guide you step by step in building a CNN for image classification, utilizing TensorFlow's easy-to-use and powerful tools.
- **Image Classification - Happy or Sad**: In this final module, we'll apply what we've learned to a real problem: classifying images as either 'happy' or 'sad'.
